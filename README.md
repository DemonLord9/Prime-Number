# Prime-Number

Easy way to find if a number "n" is prime or not.

- Check if number “n” is odd or not. (even are not prime)
- Check if any odd number “a” can be perfectly divided by “n” or not. (even number can only divide even numbers)
- “a” should be less than n/2 .

or

Simply we can check if a number is divided by 2,3,5,7 and other prime number or not.

According to my Code:

- if "n" is less than 1000 then you need first 11 prime number to see if that new number is prime or not, with accuracy of 100%.
- this input run loop for 3362 times max.

- if "n" is less than 10,000 then you need first 25 prime number to see if that new number is prime or not, with accuracy of 100%.
- this input run loop for 52413 times max.
- 5n Runtime

- if "n" is less than 20,000 then you need first 34 prime number to see if that new number is prime or not, with accuracy of 100%.
- this input run loop for 125279 times max.
